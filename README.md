# Global Terrorist Attacks

## Introduction  
Terrorism is, in its broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence (terror or fear) in order to achieve a political, religious, or ideological aim.It is classified as fourth-generation warfare and as a violent crime. In modern times, terrorism is considered a major threat to society and therefore illegal under anti-terrorism laws in most jurisdictions. It is also considered a war crime under the laws of war when used to target non-combatants, such as civilians, neutral military personnel, or enemy prisoners of war. A broad array of political organizations have practiced terrorism to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political organizations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments.The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.

This repository contains the two folders:

- **Data** This contains random artificial sample data with which we
  can demonstrate the process.
  
- **Code** This contains the R code and modelling process using R
  markdown files which can be converted to various formats, including
  pdf, html, ipynb, etc.

    
## Use Case overview 
Our target goal for this analysis are to better understand where these attacks takes place, who is responsible for these attacks and how the attacks have developed over the past 15 years. Some questions we explored in this project are:-

- Are Terriorst Attacks worldwide increasing or decreasing yearly?
- Which Countries had the highest number of attacks ?
- Which countries had the lowest number of attacks ?
- How the distribution of attacks looks like by region ?
- How dose Terrirost attacks compare between attacks in Europ and rest of the world ?
- Which Terrorist organisations are responsible for these attacks ?
- Compare between terrorst attacks and number of success  
- How is the Terrorst attachs in Europ from (2000 - 2015) did it increase or decrease or stayed stable ?
- How dose Terrorst attacks compare between Europe and rest of the world ?
- How is the Terrorst attacks in Germany ?
- Compare between terrorst attacks and number of deaths 
- How is the attacks in terms of success and failures 
- Terrirost attacks by region in the map with highest terriorst ?
- Common terrorst organisations for these attakcs ?
